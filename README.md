# btech-cse-codes

## Description

A repository that aims to contain all the codes required by the B.Tech course in CSE.

## Programmming languages 

The preferred languages that you might use are Java, C, C++ or Python3. Other languages such as Lua, JavaScript, Bash, etc. are not recommended but it's fine to upload them too. :)

## Contribution guidelines

### Your code should be ->

- Neat
- Precise
- Have a meaning
- Must be useful to the community

Once you make sure that you don't disobey any of the above, create a PR with the title as the name of the code and description of the what the code does. Also update the roadmap alongside.

Issues can be created only for -> New code creation, Updation of existing code, edit of any static resource (README.md for example). If you create a PR for any issue, make sure to mention the #tag of the issue to make it easier for us to search.
